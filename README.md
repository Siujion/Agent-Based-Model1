# Agent-Based-Model

The following is a set of codes for an agent based model. The model intends
to animate the rate at which the invasive crazy yellow ants (agents) invade an
ecosystem, degrading it until an increase in temperatre causes them to
die. In this model, an environment and a list of agents representing 
the crazy yellow ants are created. Their behavior is defined in a framework.
The code and framework are also accompanied by an intext.txt file which
contains numerical pixel values for raster data. 

The last bit of code, produces a graphic user interface inwhich users can
click on 'Run Model' to view the animation.
